I do recommend it, but just know that it's not a happy fun adventure fantasy movie. You are going to be made to think about things, climate change but also a few other themes, that are really uncomfortable to think about. It's definitely a thinking movie, and it shows a clear intention at the end that it wants you to go out and find solutions. Actually it feels a bit like Walt's personality -- he would shove the problems in your face, make you confront them, make you think that he was giving you insurmountable challenges, and he didn't care if he was hurting your feelings or making you uncomfortable, and then he would encourage you in his almost slave-driver way, until you've accomplished something you never thought was possible before. Walt thought that great things could only be accomplished by pushing the boundaries, and staying in the comfort zone had zero value to him. But the majority of moviegoers today are not interested in thinking about these ""hard facts"" (Walt loved this term), they want to be in their comfort zone for 2 hours and feel reassured. "

One could say the exact same thing about Mr. Romm."
aqgw8,"Romm has a far more nuanced view of it. He's not anti-nuclear - [he includes some in his assessment of the solution](http://climateprogress.org/2009/03/26/full-global-warming-solution-350-450-ppm-technologies-efficiency-renewables/). However, he has carefully laid out reasons why nuclear is not going to be a core solution - primarily cost and time to deploy.

I've seen no coherent argument to counter that view."
aqgw8,"Romm's ""nuance"" is to be dismissive of the largest non-CO2 emitting source we have. 

>Based on a post last year on the Keystone report, to do this by 2050 would require adding globally, an average of 17 plants each year, while building an average of 9 plants a year to replace those that will be retired, for a total of one nuclear plant every two weeks for four decades — plus 10 Yucca Mountains to store the waste. I also doubt it will be among the cheaper options. And the uranium supply and non-proliferation issues for even that scale of deployment are quite serious. See “An introduction to nuclear power.”

Using phrases like ""10 Yucca Mountains"" is ridiculous when nobody is advocating that. The same thing goes for the uranium supply. And concerns over proliferation is silly when breeder power reactors are heavily polluted with Pu-240 or U-232 and require isotopic separation. Therefore, just as in the 1940s, the best way to make a weapon is to use centrifuges on uranium ore.

Please point me to a serious discussion by Romm on breeder reactors and then maybe I will consider him a bit more credible on the issue."
aqgw8,"> ...the largest non-CO2 emitting source we have.

You need to educate yourself on nuclear and not just accept what you've read at r/science or on some blog. Nuclear is far from CO2-neutral.

Who claimed Romm had ever produced a ""serious discussion"" - whatever that means - on breeder reactors? Not me - and I'm not Google. There is one breeder on the planet - in Russia - due to be closed this year. If they're commercially viable, more will get built - but it's not happening now. Global warming is here - now.

aqgw8,">You need to educate yourself on nuclear and not just accept what you've read at r/science or on some blog. Nuclear is far from CO2-neutral.

Nothing is CO2 neutral with our current industrial infrastructure. The fact is that nuclear has about the same lifetime CO2 emissions as wind.

>Who claimed Romm had ever produced a ""serious discussion"" - whatever that means - on breeder reactors? 

I've made an effort to find anything written by him on the matter and can't find anything. This is a serious credibility problem when guys like Hansen and Lovelock talk about breeders constantly.

I also find it amusing that you will cite Romm quickly on anything else, but when a gaping hole exists in his record, you ignore it. Romm is very correct about the dangers of climate change, but his ""wedges"" solution is weak at best and will result in a terrible future.

>If they're commercially viable, more will get built - but it's not happening now

This is not about commercial viability. The IFR project was canceled because of anti-nuclear people, not because of commercial concerns.

>The lead time for new nuke tech is decades. 

No it is not. The only roadblock is anti-nuke people that get in the way. We could easily have IFRs or LFTRs already deployed by now if it wasn't for roadblockers such as yourself. And the longer we wait to get started, the more coal plants will emit CO2.

>You seem to have constructed a fantasy world where we'd all have limitless energy if it weren't for the massively powerful hippy movement stopping it all.

You can all it bizarre, but the math backs us up. We have enough U-238 and Th-232 to last for thousands, if not millions of years at current consumption levels.

If you want to deny that, then please provide specific reasons and data (and not just a link dump like you always do) that back up the claim that breeders cannot provide power for centuries.

>There are good reasons the planet is not covered in nuclear reactors - but you'd to read a bit further than reddit circle jerks and nuclear shill blogs to find out why.

>Energy source B: build, deploy and sit there collecting free energy forever - or for the life of the collector which can then be recycled and made in to another one.

Energy source A: mine very little because the plants are fairly small and breeding allows using extremely small amounts of fuel, last 80 years. (also no milling necessary for LFTR)

Energy source B: mine a ridiculous amount (because you need millions of them), last 20 years before it needs replacement.

I see the Chinese, Indians, and South Koreans building nuke plants. Lots of them in fact.

>Your belief that it's ""FUD"" is just more evidence of that fantasy world you've constructed to explain to yourself why nuclear plants aren't on every street corner.

You don't need them on every street corner. That's the point. They have high energy density. 104 of them currently provide 20% of US electricity."

Nonsense. We went from the discovery of fission to the USS Nautilus's LWRs in less time than that. A serious push would get them ready in less than a decade. Besides, we can build Gen III and IFRs now.

>I read just about everything that Hansen produces for public consumption. Your claim that he ""talks about breeders constantly."" is drivel.

Hansen didn't hesitate to mention it in his letter to Obama or on numerous interviews

>Nope. You constructed a fallacious argument known as 'begging the question'. Look it up.

Begging the question is assuming the thing you want to prove. I did no such thing. If you feel I did, then please show the form. Until then, you are yet another person misusing phrase fallacy.

>I've read widely on the subject. Multiple credible commentators assess nuclear to be not a core energy solution. You've not swayed that opinion one inch.

This is because you choose to ignore anyone that disagrees with you such as Lovelock or Brook. You just dismiss anyone that likes nuclear power as a ""zealot"" and move on with life.

aqgw8,"This has been done. If you're going to jump in to a conversation, follow it first."
aqgw8,">If. So many 'ifs'. If the nuclear fan boys' fantasies come true, we'll all be saved.

That really isn't a big ""if"" at all. It is common sense. A big ""if"" is how renewables completely depend on building up a massive grid with energy storage technologies that don't exist yet. I'd love to see it happen, but batteries aren't there, hydrogen generation is too inefficient (and requires natural gas input right now), water pumping is limited to certain geography, and other things (molten salt heating, compressed air, flywheels, etc.) are still in the research lab.

>Cite.

Watch Sorenson's Google Tech talks. He goes into detail about a plan to deploy LFTR. He said specifically that we could get an LFTR prototype in like 3 years if we went at it with a Manhattan project style effort (which isn't going to happen) and about 10 years with an aggressive but not over the top effort. Even with our current weak efforts it will be done by 2030, which is definitely soon enough to be useful in the grand scheme of things because I am not opposed to building up wind, solar, and current nuclear tech in the meantime. Overall, I think our goal should be coal free by 2030 and natural gas free by 2050. I think that is feasible with the LFTR replacing gas as base load. And maybe it won't even be necessary if the grid energy storage stuff comes through and solar gets 2-3 times more efficient with advanced materials.

>Not the same as ""talking about breeders constantly"", is it?

You are obsessed with the word ""constantly"". Hansen spends most of his time doing what he does best: discussing the effects of CO2 emissions. But he sure as hell has talked about nuclear power a lot in the last year. I've seen multiple TV interviews with him where he spent several minutes of his time talking about it. His Charlie Rose interview is really good in that respect. Lovelock, the other guy I mentioned, does talk about nuclear constantly though.

>Really - you were begging the question by assuming that ""a gaping hole exists in his record"".

That is not a begging the question fallacy.

And it is a gaping hole for him to criticize nuclear power while ignoring the primary arguments of pro-nuclear people (i.e. we need to build breeder reactors). Romm is rightly considered a top expert in the area and I think he has really been unfair in his assessments because he talks about problems that only apply to old nuclear tech.

>You choose to ignore everything that demonstrates you're building a fantasy world based on vapourware.

This isn't a fantasy world at all. Otherwise, I completely agree with Romm's outlook. I just disagree that nuclear is not a major wedge. To really deal with climate change, we need to be carbon free within a few decades and I honestly don't see how renewables can pull it off. I think if we attempt to go 100% renewables, we will be stuck with natural gas backing up our wind and solar. I'm also concerned that we will be stuck with shortages and we will be forced to have very draconian conservation measures. I'd prefer to live in a high-energy society than a low-energy society.

And I want to point out that I'm not saying that we can start building LFTRs tomorrow. You keep saying that climate change is a problem now and I agree, but we can't solve it overnight. LFTR research, even if it takes 20 years, can be the final piece of the puzzle to get rid of coal and gas. Throwing a few billion at it is really small change in the grand scheme of the energy picture because it is going to cost trillions of dollars overall no matter what to get rid of coal and gas.

So, having said all of that, are you for or against having the DoE giving say a billion dollar research grant to Oak Ridge to get a commercial LFTR design by 2020?

aqgw8,"Oh I knew very well you have already referred to this letter earlier in the thread, there are two reasons why it is very relevant.

Firstly the quote provided rebuts, with disdain, your opinion that 4th GNP won't be ready for 20 years. Amusingly the date of the 'predictable critiscism' he expected is 2030, a not so subtle hint of the parroted nature of most anti-nuke arguments'

Secondly, the letter shows that another claim you made earlier in the thread is untrue.

This is just not true. The next line in Hansen's letter after the quote I gave, as anyone who reads it can see for themselves is:

>Moreover, improved (3rd generation) light water reactors are available for near-term needs. 

That's not just a call for research into 4th GNP plants, he is directly calling for more of the current generation of nuclear reactors for our immediate energy needs, how you claim otherwise is inconceivable.

My final point is that Obama carefully chose to appoint an energy secretary who strongly supports [more nuclear power plants](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17391.html).

>No, it's not. Read some climate change science. That's the entire point of the argument.

I have. And, unlike you, I am not dismissive of any pro-nuclear arguments that I read by people like Hansen (Storms of my Grandchildren), Brand (Whole Earth Discipline), Brook, Lovelock (Revenge of Gaia, Vanishing Face of Gaia), and many others. Even Romm says that Gen IV nuclear can be a very good wedge in teh 2030-2050 range (see below). Just because I am pro-LFTR does not mean I am against all of the other wedges. You are arguing against a straw man you've made up in your mind.

>You claimed it. It's bullshit hyperbole. Own it.

I just said that Hansen talks about it in nearly every TV interview he has done lately. He also wrote about it in his letter to Obama and in his new book. That *is* constantly.

Here is a quote from his new book:

*""The bottom line seems to be that it is not feasible in the foreseeable future to phase out coal unless nuclear power is included in the energy mix.""*

>Denying the meaning of 'begging the question' does not change it.

This is getting really sad. You call something I say a fallacy even though it doesn't fit the form. I call you on that and then you continue to repeat yourself over and over again.

Let's review:

I said: ""Romm has a gaping hole in his record for not having written about Gen IV nuclear in a serious way"" 

You said: ""That is begging the question.""

I said: ""You don't know what begging the question means, retard.""

Note: I found one mention of Gen IV nuclear by Romm [here](http://climateprogress.org/2008/11/23/an-open-letter-to-james-hansen-on-the-real-truth-about-stabilizing-at-350-ppm/). Unfortunately, it is very brief and does not go into any real technical detail. He basically said it could be useful as a final wedge to get rid of coal/gas around 2030, but he has not written anything about why we shouldn't do an extremely hard push for it so it becomes available by 2020 and he just dismisses it as ""not able to get us to 350 ppm"" without discussing its usefulness for his 450 ppm plan. So, he basically argued against it using the 350 ppm strawman and was dismissive as usual, even though it can solve problems renewables cannot deal with.

>This lack of consistency demonstrates a lack of understanding. 

First, it is not a lack of consistency. If we put a lot of effort into LFTR, it could be ready by 2020. If we don't, it will probably be ready in 20 years anyways as part of the DoE's Gen IV program. You just can't read very well.

>New nuke designs require prototypes, testing, consultation periods, tech licensing, feasibility studies, contract negotiations, tender periods.

Which can all be bypassed if we have to (aka the definition of ""a serious push""). Fission went from discovery in 1938 to the first deployed power reactor in 1954 (the Soviet Obninsk plant and the USS Nautilus). There is no reason that we can't deploy LFTR technology from where we are now (with all of the physics already done and several prototypes done by Oak Ridge) to a deployed reactor in less time than it took to go from discovery of fission to first LWR deployments.

>You are - like most nuclear fantasists - naive about the technology and the process to get it 

You are the one being naive. Listen to Hansen. If we choose your route, then we will be stuck with natural gas plants and possibly even coal for the foreseeable future.

Your point that he is not infallible is a empty truism, no person is infallible.

Please wake me up when these are economical without absolutely massive subsidy. 

>Funny how so many people suddenly get concerned about wildlife when they're flapping their gums about renewables but never any other time.

Funny how I explicitly mentioned the land use but renewable supporters completely ignore it. [This wind farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Wind_Farm) generates about as much as a single coal plant (~700 MW) and uses 100,000 acres. We have about 500 coal plants in the US, so that is 50,000,000 acres just to replace the coal plants, which is an area the size of Kansas. And that does nothing to replace oil or gas consumption. It is so much easier to build about 50 nuclear plants with 4-6 1.6 GW reactors (such as the EPR-based plants being built in France right now) each. Simple math like this shows why pure renewables are completely impractical to replace coal.

I guess I can be like you and pretend that 10 million wind turbines will have no effect on wildlife.

>Do wind turbines kill wildlife? 

That article does not address future scaling of wind power.



>Wind Turbines Don't Kill Birds; Coal Plants Do

Funny, because your strategy will keep those coal plants around indefinitely.

But I love how you cite articles that compare wind to the straw man of coal. Of course coal is bad. Coal kills thousands of people per year. We need to get rid of it as soon as possible.

But I'll assume your articles are correct and just do the math. The guardian article says just 1.2 birds are killed per turbine per year (which I believe is a massive underestimate, but I'll go with it). Assuming we need 2 million (which is what Romm's wedge plan says), then that is 2.4 million birds per year.

Compare that to ""At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald, 2005)."" (and that number is from an [anti-nuke study](http://nukefree.org/news/Avianmortalityfromwindpower,fossil-fuel,andnuclearelectricity) that compares nukes with mining to wind without mining). That plant generates the equivalent of about 1200 large wind turbines.  To put that in equivalent wind turbine energy (compared to the guardian's number), that is equivalent to about 0.156 birds per turbine.

Not my opinion. I'm just giving cold hard numbers and you are ignoring them because they don't fit into your personal biases.

>Your ignorance runs wide and deep.

You can call names or you can do math. You have clearly chosen the former.

50,000,000 acres is a lot of land and also a lot of mining necessary to build all of those turbines (the Texas plant has 627 wind turbines, so 500 plants like that is 313,500 turbines, and each requires mining enough concrete and steel to build a structure larger than the statue of liberty). I know numbers hurt your head, but you really should consider learning how to do basic math because it absolutely rapes your arguments.

>lol. You're really so desperate to find stats to support your argument that you go back 30 years?! That's pathetic. Clue: bigger and slower turbines, better placement, lessons learnt.

I googled for ""nuclear power birds"" and that is the first study that came up. Read it. It is completely anti-nuclear because it attempts to compare nuclear power with mining impacts to wind without mining impact. I just grabbed the numbers killed on-site for an apples to apples comparison. Do you have other numbers for nuclear power and birds? It appears that not many people have bothered to study nuclear plants and birds because it just isn't a big deal.

Also, I seriously don't see how things would be different in the 1980s vs now. Cooling towers are the same size and birds still migrate. But you can grasp for that sad little straw if you wish. Pathetic."

Please explain why the extrapolations are invalid? Extrapolation is a very useful tool if done carefully. For example, this is how all statistical sampling is done. I'm guessing this argument has something to do with your misunderstanding of mathematical techniques.

Once again, you are just attempting to attack something minor and irrelevant rather than addressing the real points.

""In Spain a nuclear power moratorium was enacted by the socialist government in 1983.""

Looks like it was ideology and not the marketplace that stopped nuke plants there.

But luckily, they aren't stupid enough to give up what they already have...

""However, in 2009, the operating permit for the Garoña plant was extended to 42 years.""

And look how much thermofossil they still use...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_production_in_Spain.PNG

Notice that in the late 80s, nuclear power was on track to surpass thermofossil, until the idiotic decision to stop building plants was made. Spain could be almost carbon free on their power grid by now like France.

Also, notice that even with their massive efforts in renewables, nuclear still produces more energy there than wind and solar combined. And they only have 8 active nuclear plants!

No, you moron. It's because every post you've made in this sub-reddit has been down-voted."

By you and only you. Except for the posts at the top of this threat that have about 3 upvotes for me and -2 for you. That is before you banned the other people from this subreddit.

But keep on repeating yourself. Every time you do so you are admitting that you have been completely defeated in this argument.

And the next piece of evidence is the power generation breakdown for France.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_production_in_France.PNG

Notice that France generates about 8.5 times more energy from nuclear plants than from coal and gas."

aqgw8,"Actually I answered it the first time you asked it, fucktard.

>The only thing I am citing is hard data (aka reality).

The ""deployed at an accelerating rate"" is not equivalent to ""it can replace coal"". As I said, Denmark can't even get above 20% renewables. Coal and gas fill the gaps between fossil fuels and renewables. Like the US, Denmark gets about half of its electricity from coal and a fifth from gas.

Also note:

[""Denmark has the highest household electricity prices in the world""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark#Energy)"
aqgw8,"That does not answer the question.

aqgw8,"The question is attempting to use framing bias. My argument is matching reality (e.g. France has the lowest CO2 emissions among industrialized nations because of its nuclear grid). Also, the phrase ""renewables are not viable"" is not specific enough. Renewables are certainly good enough to handle part of our generation and they are politically popular (hence the subsidies are driving the current buildup), but they are not going to replace coal. Therefore, to answer your question: I am right and what I say matches reality.

The fact is simple: no country has replaced coal with renewables and no one is on track to anytime soon.

Also, by repeating yourself you are admitting defeat."
aqgw8,"OK. You had multiple chances to answer. I know why you won't. It's because reality is right and you are a clueless nobody on the internet. :)

> ...no country has replaced coal with renewables and no one is on track to anytime soon.

Ah, yes - the old ""*the planet has not switched its entire energy system already, therefore it never will*"". Are you stupid or dishonest?"
aqgw8,"[There is one country that has almost completely eliminated coal with nuclear power.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)

Now repeat after me: ""France has successfully used nuclear power to nearly eliminate coal.""
"
aqgw8,"Reality is right and you are a clueless nobody on the internet. :)

Renewables are a viable technology."
aqgw8,"Bare assertions, no evidence.

[France's power grid, on the other hand, exists.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_france)

Please give me a single reason why the US couldn't do what France did*.

\* *assuming the anti-nuclear idiots that cause massive price increases and delays in plant construction get out of the way*"
aqgw8,"You claim renewables are not viable. Reality proves you wrong.

You are simply another clueless nobody on the internet with an opinion. :)"

Thank you for demonstrating how deeply stupid you are! :)"
aqgw8,"You are a pathetic troll.

Congrats though. Every time you respond with this kind of crap, it is yet more evidence for other people to judge from. This is why the environmentalist movement is gradually turning pro-nuclear."

aqgw8,That isn't bad news at all. I've said all along that I'm in favor of subsidies for renewables. They are not coal. But that doesn't change the basic math of nuclear vs. renewables.
aqgw8,"Are you ready to own your argument yet?

""*Because no country has switched 100% in the last few years no country ever will!*""

Thank you for demonstrating how deeply stupid you are! :)"
aqgw8,"Keep on repeating yourself by misrepresenting what I said. I'll keep mocking you for being an idiot. If you had a real argument, you would make it rather than repeat shit you made up.

Also, drop the pathetic ""you are trying to submit too fast. try again in X minutes"" crap. That is only happening on this sub-reddit that you are admin on. It further demonstrates that you cannot win an argument."
aqgw8,"And it ain't me looking like an idiot when your argument against renewable is:

""*Because no country has switched 100% in the last few years no country ever will!*""

What an idiot *you* are! lol"
