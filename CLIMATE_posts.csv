ophn1l,ClimateCrisis,1626972021.0,"Done Waiting is a progressive, grassroots organization that advocates for and endorses progressive candidates and policies around the country.

In our first 2 months, we made 60,000 calls (without a dialer) for Adam Christensen, a progressive candidate that ran in Florida’s 3rd Congressional District. Since the election, we have made calls to constituents urging them to call their representatives to support the Green New Deal, and we have made calls to people in Georgia to get them to register and vote in the runoff election.

We’ve recently been working on behalf of Nina Turner’s campaign for Representative of Ohio’s 11th district. We made almost 30,000 calls for her campaign in the first week since our endorsement.

We are a completely volunteer-run organization, mainly consisting of students. If you would be so generous as to give us any financial support, it would go toward things like:


Investing in infrastructure to help our dedicated army of phone bankers reach even more people per hour (current output exceeds 1200 hours/week)
Buying essential voter data to bolster our proprietary advocacy software and increase voter outreach in strategic areas
Covering minimal overhead costs related to communications and legal compliance
Your donation would only go toward operating costs, nobody working in this organization gets paid so none of the money will enter our pockets.

Our donation link can be found [here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/donewaiting). 

If you would like to offer us some financial support but also get something in return, we have some items available at our new [merch store](https://www.donewaiting.org/shop). We sell t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, and more, all designed by our merch team.

If you can’t support us financially but would still like to assist us in another way, you can volunteer with us by filling out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mRJ_81wYDz0j1BN8WUzuJHn9K7VsPqBbcO0XjIWIhJc/viewform?edit_requested=true) application, which takes about 30 seconds.

[Here](https://www.donewaiting.org/) is our website so you can learn more about us. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask!

We greatly appreciate any contribution you’re able to make. We recognize that this is a very difficult time so, above all, please stay as safe and healthy as possible. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateCrisis/comments/ophn1l/were_done_waiting_an_organization_fighting_for/,"We’re Done Waiting, an organization fighting for progressive candidates and policies, and we’re asking for your support",,9,2,0.92
npyioe,ClimateCrisis,1622566184.0,"We are a group that advocates for and endorses progressive candidates and policies. We endorse progressive candidates and help them in elections by making thousands of calls to voters on their behalf. 

We also pressure centrist politicians that are already in office into supporting policies like Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, Debt-Free College, and getting corporate money out of politics. 

We’re sick of half-measures and incremental changes that do nothing to help average, working-class people. We’re tired of being told to wait for reforms that are long overdue, especially when we’re running out of time for bold, comprehensive action on issues like climate change. 

We will never refuse to endorse a progressive candidate based on who their opponent is. We refuse to ignore those that are in races against powerful people, as these are often some of the most important races to be won.

We will rescind an endorsement if a candidate backs an establishment candidate over a progressive, if they take any corporate money, or if they compromise the progressive values that we endorsed them for in the first place.

We’re sick of a status quo that only works for the wealthy and the elite.

In our first 2 months, we made 60,000 calls (without a dialer) for Adam Christensen, a progressive candidate that ran in Florida’s 3rd Congressional District. Since the election, we have also made calls to constituents urging them to call their representatives to get them to support the Green New Deal, and we have also made calls in Georgia to get people to register and vote in the runoff election. 

After that we began making calls to voters to increase support for Medicare For All. Since, we have endorsed Nina Turner’s campaign for Representative of Ohio’s 11th District and have been performing outreach on her campaign’s behalf for her primary election on August 3rd. In our first week phone banking for her campaign, our phone bankers made 28,649 calls on her behalf.

If these issues interest you and you would like to learn more about us, you can visit our website at [this link](https://www.donewaiting.org/). 

There you can find more information about us and the policies that we support, as well as the candidates we have endorsed. If someone you know is looking for an endorsement, they can apply for one there as well.

You can also apply to volunteer to help us carry out our mission. This is an entirely volunteer-run organization, and we welcome anyone that would like to volunteer their time to fight for these policies. You can meet plenty of other young, like-minded progressives from all over the country, and the application only takes about 30 seconds. The application can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mRJ_81wYDz0j1BN8WUzuJHn9K7VsPqBbcO0XjIWIhJc/viewform?edit_requested=true).

g62mq8,ClimateCrisis,1587567602.0,"I am running a grassroots campaign against an 85-year political dynasty in MI-12, and I am fighting for progressive policies such as a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Tuition Free College and Eliminating Student Debt, and Getting Corporate Money Out of Politics.

The biggest reason that I decided to run was climate change. Our environment and economy will be ravaged by climate change if we do not act before we run out of time.That’s why I support enacting a Green New Deal so that we can begin to mobilize our economy away from our dependence on fossil fuels and create millions of green energy jobs. Climate change is not an issue that our current politicians can continue to ignore and I’m done waiting for action.

I am taking a leave of absence from medical school to run because I am done waiting on our current politicians to act on issues like climate change or enacting single-payer healthcare. Previously, I worked as an organizer for the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. I also founded a group called the Michigan Resistance, a political activist group that made thousands of calls to stop bad legislation in the Michigan State Legislature.

I am also a part of the Rose Caucus, a group of anti-establishment Democratic Socialist and Socialist candidates running for various offices across the United States.

If you would like to learn more about me, donate to support our campaign, or join our fellowship program (which is completely remote), you can go to my website, [SolomonRajput.com](https://www.solomonrajput.com/) . We’re always looking for more volunteers nationwide that would like to help us do phone banking or text banking.

You can also check out my social media where we post campaign updates, policy updates, event invites, announcements, jokes, and memes.

py1231,ClimateCrisis,1632938716.0,"SearchScene is a charitable search engine that donates 95% of its profits to charities fighting climate change. As a user, I believe using this is one of the best ways a person can help the environment. It takes zero effort to use. All you do is use the internet like you always do, and save the environment at the same time. It's a win-win! Here's some more detail:

# Donations:

* Donates 95% of its profits to charity, more than any other engine.
* Support 6 charities, all fighting different fields in climate change. You can choose which ones you want your money to go to.
* [If this site had as much money as Google](https://www.searchscene.com/we-donate-95-to-charity), it could replant the Amazon Rainforest, end world hunger, eradicate Polio, and so much more.
* Shows their [donation receipts](https://www.searchscene.com/pdf/SearchScene-Donation-Receipts-Apr-May-2021.pdf), to prove they're legit.

# Anyone Could Use it:

* Download on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/searchscene-%E2%80%93-the-charita/mhbnohclbfjlnkjegnfhpidjlejbdgci?hl=en-GB), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/searchscene-%E2%80%93-the-charita/odgpoigmpeehjhohfjobjgbcjgdcfmpn), or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/searchscene/), and you're done.
* Download on Android or IOS.
* Completely free. You don't have to pay a cent.

Note: if you don't see the apps or advertising, it might not be available in your country. It'll come to more places in 2022.

# Homepage

* It has some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen in my life.
* Very customizable. You can use your own images if you want, or a simple black and white background.

# Search Results

* Offers larger knowledge panels than Google, making it easier and quicker to find info.
* Has an option to show results from Google, if you can't find what you're looking for.

# Privacy

* Your searches aren't stored on their servers.
* If you create an account, your email is encrypted. The only thing the servers will know is the number of searches you made, not the actual things you searched for.
* Your searches are encrypted.
* Both it's Android and IOS apps run off Firefox, giving more privacy.

# Extra Points:

* Create groups with your friends, family, school, etc. Store up your searches. Compete with other groups to see who can get the most searches.
* See the [impact](https://www.searchscene.com/my-impact) you yourself are making. It looks at what charities you support and the number of searches you made to estimate the impact you've made.

This is still a new site, yet it has done so much, and still has so much potential. At least try it for a few days, and see what you think.

Broad cited several scientists who criticized Gore's portrayal of global warming as a terrible catastrophe that would cause rising temperatures, seas that could rise twenty feet, and more frequent and deadlier storms. According to the scientists quoted in the article, temperatures were the highest in four hundred years, but no higher than sixteen hundred years ago during the Medieval Warm Period. storms than predicted \(five instead of nine \), none of which hit the United States . Similarly, even if seas are expected to rise, most experts think it will be a very slow process. Other researchers have developed mathematical climate models, which allow for predictions to be made about temperature changes when the amount of carbon dioxide input is increased. In recent decades, these climate models have been greatly improved through the use of computers, which can incorporate enormous amounts of weather information into climate formulas and produce more accurate predictions of changes. on the future climate   Also during the last twenty years, scientists began to use satellites to observe the Earth's changing climate.
